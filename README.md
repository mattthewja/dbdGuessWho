# DBD Guess Who

A simple "guess who" themed around the characters from the popular async game by Behaviour Interactive "Dead by Daylight".

The Web App is very simple and allows for anyone with two devices and a form of communication with a friend to play.

- When a user opens the site (or reloads), they are given a random character from the cast and a board with every character
- They then ask their friend questions through the usual guess who methods to try to win the game.
- Since the Web App does not connect players, all gameplay goes through peer to peer communication like discord.

## Devlog / Motivation

I started this project because when my friend and I got the idea to play guess who of a video game we were both familiar with, we found that there wasn't any available site or app to help us set up the guess who board and randomise our characters. So I took up this project to create this simple app and to learn more about frontend development and tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
