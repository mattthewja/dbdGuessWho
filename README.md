# DBD Guess Who

A simple "guess who" themed around the characters from the popular async game by Behaviour Interactive "Dead by Daylight".

The Web App is very simple and allows for anyone with two devices and a form of communication with a friend to play.

- When a user opens the site (or reloads), they are given a random character from the cast and a board with every character
- They then ask their friend questions through the usual guess who methods to try to win the game.
- Since the Web App does not connect players, all gameplay goes through peer to peer communication tools like discord.

## Devlog / Motivation

I started this project because when my friend and I got the idea to play guess who of a video game we were both familiar with, we found that there wasn't any available site or app to help us set up the guess who board and randomise our characters. So I took up this project to create this simple app and to learn more about frontend development and tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Additionally, I made this project expecting the need to maintain the Web App and looking forward to learning about that sort of process. The problem with working on academic projects is that there isn't much to learn about how to do things correctly, so I wanted this little project as an entry into writing self-documentating code as a standard and how to maintain projects with update logs and more.

## Future plans
As of today, 23-Jul-25, I have plans of maybe integrating a chatting system and a way for users to connect to eachother with a shared gamestate, but I do not know what I will be getting myself into. Either way, I hope to keep true on my own word of keeping this web app updated.

# For the users and readers
I am very happy you found this small project of mine, if the game helped you and your friends enjoy for some time, that is all that matters. Thank you.
